- **`get_or_create_clinic` matches by display name.** The name is not unique, not trimmed,
  and case-sensitive. Fine for one dev clinic; fragile for multi-clinic provisioning. Next
  action: decide in a later slice whether `create-user` should take `--clinic-id` or a
  stable slug instead.
- **Patient “registered” date on detail.** The UI shows the `YYYY-MM-DD` prefix of
  `created_at` (UTC), not the clinic timezone. Next action: revisit when front desk reports
  wrong calendar day near midnight.
